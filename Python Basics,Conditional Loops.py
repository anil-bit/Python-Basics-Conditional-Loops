'''
1. Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included). The numbers obtained should be printed
in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.
'''

j = []
#print(a)
for u in range(2000,3200+1):
    #print(u)
    if u%7 == 0 and u%5!= 0:

2. Write a Python program to accept the user's first and last name and then getting them printed in the the reverse order with a space between first name and last name.
'''

first_name = input("enter your first name:")
last_name = input("enter your last name:")
